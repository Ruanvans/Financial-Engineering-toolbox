Financial engineering

Introduction

All the code written in this repository is used for the completion of the online course "Financial Engineering and Risk Management I", this course was undertaken for me to develop my skills both in terms of finance as well as developing code that allows for the pricing of financial instruments. The code is written in C++, this is done for two main reasons; the first being that this is a good opportunity for me to improve my C++ programming and the second reason being that C++ is very fast computationally.
